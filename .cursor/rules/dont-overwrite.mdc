## Code Editing Rules

1. **Only edit code directly related to the user's request**
   - Do NOT modify, reformat, or "improve" code that is not part of the requested change
   - Do NOT revert previous changes unless explicitly asked
   - If you need to edit unrelated code to fix a dependency, ASK THE USER FIRST

2. **When using edit_file or search_replace:**
   - Be surgical: only change the specific lines needed
   - Verify you're not accidentally reverting previous work
   - If the edit tool makes unexpected changes, use read_file to verify before deploying

3. **Preserve existing functionality:**
   - Don't remove working code unless explicitly requested
   - Don't change indentation, formatting, or structure of unrelated code
   - Don't "clean up" or "refactor" unless that's the specific request
